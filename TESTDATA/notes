from Figure 7: "Figure 7 New alterations in the RTK–Rho/Ras– Raf pathway in lung ADC. Lung ADCs were
classified as oncogene positive if they harbored a known activating or recurrent alteration in
previously characterized pathway components and were classified as oncogene negative
otherwise. (a) Fifteen genes (red points) were significantly enriched for mutations among
oncogene-negative tumors (Fisher’s exact test, FDR q value < 0.1; supplementary table 23).
A log-transformed odds ratio (LOR) greater than 0 indicates that the frequency of mutations
was higher in the oncogene-negative set.  (b) Significant amplification peaks near FGFR1–
WHSC1L1, PDGFRA–KIT–KDR, and MAPK1 were only found in the oncogene-negative tumor
set using GISTIC 2.0 (q value < 0.25). (c) Co- mutation plot for known and new activators of
the pathway. Tumors were considered to have high-level amplification for a given gene if they
had a total log2-transformed copy number ratio greater than 1. For genes with gain-of-function
SSNVs or indels, only recurrently mutated sites or sites with previous experimental functional
evidence were included. New genes enriched for alterations among oncogene-negative tumors
that are members of the RTK–Rho/Ras–Raf pathway are labeled in red in all panels. Dashed
lines separate tumors that harbor a known or putative alteration in this pathway (n = 499),
tumors that do not harbor an alteration in this pathway but have a mutation in STK11 (n =
28), and tumors that do not harbor an alteration in this pathway or STK11 (n = 133). NA,
RNA-seq data were not available.
